# CipherStream: Secure Data Transformation Pipeline

CipherStream provides a robust and flexible framework for implementing secure data transformation pipelines within TypeScript applications. It abstracts away the complexities of cryptographic operations and data stream management, allowing developers to focus on the core logic of their transformations while ensuring data is protected at every stage of the process.

CipherStream offers a modular architecture that supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and data formats. It allows for the creation of custom transformation units which can be chained together to form complex data processing workflows. These workflows can include encryption, decryption, compression, decompression, data validation, and other transformations, all executed within a secure and controlled environment. The primary goal is to provide a developer-friendly toolkit that minimises the risk of security vulnerabilities arising from ad-hoc cryptographic implementations. This ensures best practices are followed while maintaining performance and scalability.

This library is designed for applications that require strong data security, such as secure data storage, encrypted communication channels, and data anonymization pipelines. It aims to simplify the process of implementing these security measures by providing a clear and consistent API. CipherStream also emphasizes data integrity, ensuring that transformed data remains consistent and tamper-proof. The framework includes built-in error handling and logging mechanisms to aid in debugging and monitoring data transformation processes.

CipherStream is built with performance in mind, leveraging asynchronous operations and stream processing techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. It provides mechanisms for configuring and optimizing data processing pipelines based on specific application requirements. The framework is highly configurable allowing developers to tailor the underlying cryptographic algorithms, key management strategies, and data format configurations. This level of customization allows the CipherStream to be applied across multiple security requirements.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Transformation Units:** Create reusable transformation units using a simple interface, enabling complex data processing pipelines. Each unit operates on a stream of data, applying a specific transformation function.
*   **Configurable Cryptographic Algorithms:** Supports a wide range of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, including AES, RSA, and ChaCha20. The specific algorithms used in each pipeline can be configured through the framework's API.
*   **Asynchronous Stream Processing:** Leverages asynchronous stream processing to handle large data sets efficiently and minimize blocking operations. The library makes use of `async/await` constructs for improved readability and maintainability.
*   **Integrated Key Management:** Offers flexible key management options, including the ability to generate, store, and retrieve cryptographic keys securely. It supports integration with external key management systems.
*   **Data Integrity Verification:** Includes mechanisms for verifying the integrity of transformed data, such as cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures. These mechanisms help prevent tampering and ensure data authenticity.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Provides robust error handling and logging capabilities to aid in debugging and monitoring data transformation processes. Error logs can be configured to include detailed information about the source of errors and the state of the pipeline.
*   **Type Safety:** Built with TypeScript, CipherStream provides strong type safety throughout the framework, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving code maintainability.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language, providing strong typing and modern language features for improved code quality and maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing CipherStream applications.
*   **crypto (Node.js built-in):** Used for cryptographic operations, providing a reliable and secure foundation for the library's security features. This module is used for generating keys, performing encryption/decryption, and calculating hash values.
*   **stream (Node.js built-in):** Used for handling data streams efficiently, enabling the processing of large data sets without loading them into memory.

## Installation

1.  **Install Node.js:** Ensure that Node.js version 16 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Node.js website.
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/CipherStream.git
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    cd CipherStream
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    npm install
5.  **Compile the TypeScript code:**
    npm run build

## Configuration

CipherStream can be configured using environment variables and configuration objects passed to the constructor of the pipeline and individual transformation units.

*   **Environment Variables:**
    *   `CIPHERSTREAM_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level for the application (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`).
    *   `CIPHERSTREAM_KEY_PATH`: Specifies the path to a directory containing cryptographic keys.

*   **Configuration Objects:**
    Individual transformation units can be configured using configuration objects. For example:

    const aesConfig = {
        algorithm: 'aes-256-cbc',
        key: 'YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY',
        iv: 'YOUR_INITIALIZATION_VECTOR'
    };

## Usage

Here's a basic example of creating and using a CipherStream pipeline:

// Example Code:
// import { CipherStreamPipeline } from './src/cipher-stream-pipeline';
// import { AESEncryptionUnit } from './src/transformation-units/aes-encryption-unit';
// import { FileSource } from './src/data-sources/file-source';
// import { FileDestination } from './src/data-destinations/file-destination';
// const inputFile = 'input.txt';
// const outputFile = 'output.enc';
// const aesConfig = {
//     algorithm: 'aes-256-cbc',
//     key: 'YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY',
//     iv: 'YOUR_INITIALIZATION_VECTOR'
// };
// async function main() {
//     const source = new FileSource(inputFile);
//     const destination = new FileDestination(outputFile);
//     const encryptionUnit = new AESEncryptionUnit(aesConfig);
//     const pipeline = new CipherStreamPipeline(source, destination, [encryptionUnit]);
//     await pipeline.run();
//     console.log('Encryption complete.');
// }
// main();

This example demonstrates a simple pipeline that reads data from an input file, encrypts it using AES, and writes the encrypted data to an output file. Remember to replace `YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `YOUR_INITIALIZATION_VECTOR` with appropriate values.
